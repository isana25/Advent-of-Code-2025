## Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for **Advent of Code 2025**, an annual coding challenge that releases one programming problem each day during the month of December. The goal is to solve logic and algorithm-based puzzles using code.

Each folder/file in this repository includes:
- The **original problem description**
- My **solution / approach**
- Any **important notes or explanations**

This README serves as an overview of the challenges I’ve completed and how I approached solving them.
